**A simple non-oriented graph editor  --  created for a university project**

This editor allows you to create and manipulate graphes' nodes, edges and to colorate them using the DSATUR algorithm.
The application can switch between a matrix representation of the graph and a list one (that feature, which is not
visible by the user instead of a notification, was one of the requirements of the subject).
It also allows you to save your current graph,load a saved one and export your graph as a PNG image file.

Since it was created for a university project, this editor is a really basic one (not threaded at all),
with unimplemented features (such as undo/redo) which weren't priority goals in the subject.
For the same reason, Gatrimi is likely not going to be developed anymore (though it could be ONE DAY if one or several
of the authors decide to restart the work). So the purpose of it is essentially to show interested people what
the team that created Gatrimi was capable of at half part of their 3rd year of IT License.

Since the application is not likely to be maintened, please do not email the authors for bugs or feature suggestions.
Though you can write an email to tristan.louet@etu.univ-rouen.fr to comment or critic (either badly or nicely) the
code ONLY IF you keep in mind that the project was created in a universitary context which mean that we didn't, at the
time, had the knowledge of such things as Java's thread for example.

You can find a user manual written in French that explains how the application works (since it's a basic application,
it's easy to find out how to use it by yourself though).

**Known bugs**
- A dirty zone makes nodes look weird at the top left corner of the editor. The reason of it is currently unknown.
